# Problem

Let $A$ be the set of all integers not of the form $p+2^{k}+2^l$ (where $k,l\geq 0$ and $p$ is prime). Is the upper
density of $A$ positive?

# Remarks

Crocker \cite{Cr71} has proved there are are $\gg\log\log N$ such integers in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ (any number of the form
$2^{2^m}-1$ with $m\geq 3$ suffices). Pan \cite{Pa11} improved this to $\gg_\epsilon N^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>
0$. Erd\H{o}s believes this cannot be proved by covering systems, i.e. integers of the form $p+2^k+2^l$ exist in every
infinite arithmetic progression.
