# Problem

For any $C>0$ are there infinitely many $n$ such that
\[p_{n+1}-p_n> C\frac{\log\log n\log\log\log\log n}{(\log\log \log n)^2}\log n?\]

# Remarks

The peculiar quantitative form of Erd\H{o}s' question was motivated by an old result of Rankin \cite{Ra38}, who proved
there exists some constant $C>0$ such that the claim holds. Solved by Maynard \cite{Ma16} and Ford, Green, Konyagin, and
Tao \cite{FGKT16}. The best bound available, due to all five authors \cite{FGKMT18}, is that there are infinitely many
$n$ such that
\[p_{n+1}-p_n\gg \frac{\log\log n\log\log\log\log n}{\log\log \log n}\log n.\]
The likely truth is a lower bound like $\gg(\log n)^2$. In \cite{Er97c} Erd\H{o}s revised the value of this problem to
\$5000 and reserved the \$10000 for a lower bound of $>(\log n)^{1+c}$ for some $c>0$.
