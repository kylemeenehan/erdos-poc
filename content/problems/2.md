# Problem

Can the smallest modulus of a covering system be arbitrarily large?

# Remarks

Described by Erd\H{o}s as `perhaps my favourite problem'. Hough \cite{Ho15}, building on work of Filaseta, Ford,
Konyagin, Pomerance, and Yu \cite{FFKPY07}, has shown the answer is no: the smallest modulus must be at most $10^{18}$.
{P}
An alternative, simpler, proof was given by Balister, Bollob\'{a}s, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba \cite{BBMST22}, who
improved the bound on the smallest modulus to $616000$.
