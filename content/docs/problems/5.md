# Problem

Let $C\geq 0$. Is there an infinite sequence of $n_i$ such that
\[\lim_{i\to \infty}\frac{p_{n_i+1}-p_{n_i}}{\log n_i}=C?\]

# Remarks

Let $S$ be the set of limit points of $(p_{n+1}-p_n)/\log n$. This problem asks whether $S=[0,\infty]$. Although this
conjecture remains unproven, a lot is known about $S$. Some highlights:
- $\infty\in S$ by Westzynthius' result \cite{We31} on large prime gaps,
- $0\in S$ by the work of Goldston, Pintz, and Yildirim \cite{GPY09} on small prime gaps,
- Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er55} and Ricci \cite{Ri56} independently showed that $S$ has positive Lebesgue measure,
- Hildebrand and Maier \cite{HiMa88} showed that $S$ contains arbitrarily large (finite) numbers,
- Pintz \cite{Pi16} showed that there exists some small constant $c>0$ such that $[0,c]\subset S$,
- Banks, Freiberg, and Maynard \cite{BFM16} showed that at least $12.5\%$ of $[0,\infty)$ belongs to $S$,
- Merikoski \cite{Me20} showed that at least $1/3$ of $[0,\infty)$ belongs to $S$, and that $S$ has bounded
gaps.
