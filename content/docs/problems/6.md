# Problem

Let $d_n=p_{n+1}-p_n$. Are there infinitely many $n$ such that $d_n<d_{n+1}<d_{n+2}$?

# Remarks

Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'{a}n \cite{ErTu48}. Shockingly Erd\H{o}s offered \$25000 for a disproof of this, but
as he comments, it `is certainly true'.

Indeed, the answer is yes, as proved by Banks, Freiberg, and Turnage-Butterbaugh \cite{BFT15} with an application of the
Maynard-Tao machinery concerning bounded gaps between primes \cite{Ma15}. They in fact prove that, for any $m\geq 1$,
there are infinitely many $n$ such that
\[d_n<d_{n+1}<\cdots <d_{n+m}\]
and infinitely many $n$ such that
\[d_n> d_{n+1}>\cdots >d_{n+m}.\]
