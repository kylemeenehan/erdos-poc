# Problem

For any finite colouring of the integers is there a covering system all of whose moduli are monochromatic?

# Remarks

Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Graham, who also ask about a density-type version: for example, is
\[\sum_{\substack{a\in A\\ a>N}}\frac{1}{a}\gg \log N\]
a sufficient condition for $A$ to contain the moduli of a covering system?

The answer (to both colouring and density versions) is no, due to the result of Hough \cite{Ho15} on the minimum size of
a modulus in a covering system - in particular one could colour all integers $<10^{18}$ different colours and all other
integers a new colour.
