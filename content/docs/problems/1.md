# Problem

If $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ with $\lvert A\rvert=n$ is such that the subset sums $\sum_{a\in S}a$ are distinct for
all $S\subseteq A$ then
\[N \gg 2^{n}.\]

# Remarks

Erd≈ës called this `perhaps my first serious problem'. The powers of $2$ show that $2^n$ would be best possible here. The
trivial lower bound is $N \gg 2^{n}/n$, since all $2^n$ distinct subset sums must lie in $[0,Nn)$.
Erd\H{o}s and Moser \cite{Er56} proved
$$ N\geq (\tfrac{1}{4}-o(1))\frac{2^n}{\sqrt{n}}.$$
A number of improvements of the constant have been given (see \cite{St23} for a history),
with the current record $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ first proved in unpublished work of Elkies and Gleason.
Two proofs achieving this constant are provided by Dubroff, Fox, and Xu \cite{DFX21},
who in fact prove the exact bound $N\geq \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$.

In \cite{Er73} and \cite{ErGr80} the generalisation where $A\subseteq (0,N]$ is a set of real numbers such that the
subset sums all differ by at least $1$ is proposed, with the same conjectured bound. (The second proof of \cite{DFX21}
applies also to this generalisation.)
