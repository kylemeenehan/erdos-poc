# Problem

Is there some $k$ such that every integer is the sum of a prime and at most $k$ powers of 2?

# Remarks

Erd\H{o}s described this as `probably unattackable'. In \cite{ErGr80} Erd\H{o}s and Graham suggest that no such $k$
exists. Gallagher \cite{Ga75} has shown that for any $\epsilon>0$ there exists $k(\epsilon)$ such that the set of
integers which are the sum of a prime and at most $k(\epsilon)$ many powers of 2 has lower density at least
$1-\epsilon$.

Granville and Soundararajan \cite{GrSo98} have conjectured that at most $3$ powers of 2 suffice for all odd integers,
and hence at most $4$ powers of $2$ suffice for all even integers. (The restriction to odd integers is important here -
for example, Bogdan Grechuk has observed that $1117175146$ is not the sum of a prime and at most $3$ powers of $2$, and
pointed out that parity considerations, coupled with the fact that there are many integers not the sum of a prime and
$2$ powers of $2$ (see {PROBLEM=9}) suggest that there exist infinitely many even integers which are not the sum of a
prime and at most $3$ powers of $2$).
