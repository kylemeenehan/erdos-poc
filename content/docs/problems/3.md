# Problem

If $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ has $\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}=\infty$ then must $A$ contain arbitrarily long arithmetic
progressions?

# Remarks

This is essentially asking for good bounds on $r_k(N)$, the size of the largest subset of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ without a
non-trivial $k$-term arithmetic progression. For example, a bound like
\[r_k(N) \ll_k \frac{N}{(\log N)(\log\log N)^2}\]
would be sufficient.

Even the case $k=3$ is non-trivial, but was proved by Bloom and Sisask \cite{BlSi20}. Much better bounds for $r_3(N)$
were subsequently proved by Kelley and Meka \cite{KeMe23}. Green and Tao \cite{GrTa17} proved $r_4(N)\ll N/(\log N)^{c}$
for some small constant $c>0$. Gowers \cite{Go01} proved
\[r_k(N) \ll \frac{N}{(\log\log N)^{c_k}},\]
where $c_k>0$ is a small constant depending on $k$. The current best bounds for general $k$ are due to Leng, Sah, and
Sawhney \cite{LSS24}, who show that
\[r_k(N) \ll \frac{N}{\exp(-(\log\log N)^{c_k})}\]
for some constant $c_k>0$ depending on $k$.

Curiously, Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er83c} thought this conjecture was the 'only way to approach' the conjecture that there are
arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers, now a theorem due to Green and Tao \cite{GrTa08}.
