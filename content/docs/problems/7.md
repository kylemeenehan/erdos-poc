# Problem

Is there a covering system all of whose moduli are odd?

# Remarks

Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge (sometimes also with Schinzel). They also asked whether there can be a covering system
such that all the moduli are odd and squarefree. The answer to this stronger question is no, proved by Balister,
Bollob\'{a}s, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba \cite{BBMST22}.

Hough and Nielsen \cite{HoNi19} proved that at least one modulus must be divisible by either $2$ or $3$. A simpler proof
of this fact was provided by Balister, Bollob\'{a}s, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba \cite{BBMST22}.

Selfridge has shown (as reported in \cite{Sc67}) that such a covering system exists if a covering system exists with
moduli $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ such that no $n_i$ divides any other $n_j$ (but the latter has been shown not to exist, see
{PROBLEM=586}).
